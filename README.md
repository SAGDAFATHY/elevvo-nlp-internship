# 🌟 Elevvo Internship – NLP Track

I’m excited to share my work from the **Elevvo NLP Internship**, where I successfully completed multiple real-world projects focusing on text processing, classification, and topic discovery.  
This internship helped me apply NLP techniques practically and improve both my technical and problem-solving skills. 🚀

---

## 🧠 Overview
During this internship, I worked on five different NLP tasks that reflect real-world use cases in text analytics and machine learning.  
Each task involved data preprocessing, feature extraction (TF-IDF / embeddings), model training, and performance evaluation.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **NLTK**
- **spaCy**
- **Gensim**
- **pyLDAvis**
- **Matplotlib**, **WordCloud**

## 💡 Key Learning Outcomes
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)
- Text vectorization using TF-IDF
- Building and evaluating ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM)
- Named Entity Recognition with spaCy
- Topic Modeling with LDA
- Data visualization and interpretation
